# ClickTime Dev Internship | Question 2: Making a Good Impression

## A simple web app that takes the user's current location and routes them to a random coffee shop and donut shop on the way to the ClickTime offices. Uses the Google Maps places library to search for restaurants nearby the office so the food/drink will still be hot and ready when you arrive. Has the option to switch between walking, biking, and public transit as the method of transportation.
